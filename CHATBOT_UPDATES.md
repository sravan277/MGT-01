# Chatbot Feature Updates

## ✅ Fixed Issues

### 1. **Model Compatibility Fix**
**Problem**: API was returning "404 models/gemini-pro is not found"
**Solution**: Updated to use `gemini-2.5-flash` model which is available with your API key
- Changed in: `backend/app/services/chatbot_service.py`
- Model `gemini-2.5-flash` is newer, faster, and better than the old gemini-pro

### 2. **Auto Suggestions Always Visible**
**Problem**: Suggested questions only showed on first message
**Solution**: 
- Suggestions now always visible (not just at start)
- Added "Refresh" button to get new suggestions anytime
- Auto-refreshes after each message exchange
- Shows with 💡 emoji for better visibility

**Changes**:
- Added `refreshSuggestions()` function
- Changed condition from `messages.length === 1` to `!isLoading`
- Calls refresh after each message sent

### 3. **Quiz Generation Improvements**
**Problem**: Submit button appearing without proper questions
**Solution**: Enhanced quiz parsing and validation

**Backend Improvements** (`chatbot_service.py`):
- Better parsing for different question formats
- Detects: "Q:", "Question", or numbered questions (1., 2., etc.)
- Handles options with A), A., or A: formats
- Validates all questions have:
  - Question text
  - 4 options minimum
  - Correct answer
  - Explanation
- Filters out invalid questions
- Logs parsing results for debugging

**Frontend Improvements** (`PaperChatbot.jsx`):
- Shows "No quiz questions available" if generation fails
- Validates questions before rendering
- Submit button only appears if valid questions exist
- Shows progress: "Submit Quiz (2/5 answered)"
- Loading toast during generation
- Success toast shows number of questions generated
- Better error handling with specific messages
