## 🛠️ Technology Stack

### Backend
- **Framework**: FastAPI
- **AI Model**: Google Gemini Pro
- **Library**: google-generativeai
- **Language**: Python 3.x

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React 18
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS
- **Animations**: Framer Motion

## 📊 Architecture Flow

```
User uploads PDF
    ↓
PDF processed & stored with paper_id
    ↓
User navigates to Output Selection
    ↓
Chatbot button appears
    ↓
User clicks button → Chatbot opens
    ↓
Backend loads paper context (text extraction)
    ↓
AI generates suggested questions
    ↓
User asks questions → AI responds with context
    ↓
User generates quiz → AI creates 5 questions
    ↓
User answers → System grades & shows results
```

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

- ✅ API keys stored in environment variables
- ✅ No hardcoded credentials
- ✅ Paper content sent to Gemini API (Google's privacy policy applies)
- ✅ Conversation history in-memory (not persisted to database)
- ✅ No user data logged permanently

## 📈 Performance Considerations

- **Context Limiting**: Paper text truncated to 30k characters
- **History Management**: Only last 5 exchanges kept in context
- **Lazy Loading**: Chatbot only loads when opened
- **Caching**: Paper context cached per session
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking API calls
